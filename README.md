# Day 1 – Sliding Window Technique
Today I learned the **Sliding Window** technique in DSA.  
It is used to efficiently solve problems related to **subarrays** and **substrings** by maintaining a moving window instead of recalculating values repeatedly.  
This helps reduce the time complexity from **O(n²)** to **O(n)** and is widely used in array and string problems.
