\# Day 01 - Sliding Window Technique



\## 📌 Topic

Sliding Window



\## 🧠 What I Learned

\- What sliding window technique is

\- Why it is more efficient than brute force

\- How the window moves through the array



\## 🧩 Problem Practiced

\- Maximum Sum Subarray of Size K (LeetCode 643)



\## 🚀 Approach

\- Take first k elements as initial window

\- Slide the window by removing left and adding next right element

\- Track maximum sum



\## ⏱ Time \& Space Complexity

\- Time: O(n)

\- Space: O(1)



\## 📝 Notes

Sliding window helps avoid nested loops and repeated summation work.
