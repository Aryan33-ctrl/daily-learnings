## Day 3 – Bubble Sort (DSA)
1) Learned what Bubble Sort is and how it works by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements.
2) Understood that in each pass, the largest element moves to the end of the array.
3) Implemented Bubble Sort in Java using nested loops and swapping logic.
4) Learned its time complexity: O(n²) in worst and average case, and O(n) in best case.
5) Understood where Bubble Sort is used: small datasets and for teaching sorting basics.
