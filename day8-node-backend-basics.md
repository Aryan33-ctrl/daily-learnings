# 📘 Daily Learning – Day 8

## Topic: Basics of Node.js for Backend Development

---

## 🔹 What I Learned Today

Today, I learned the **fundamentals of Node.js** and how it is used to build backend applications.

---

## 🔹 What is Node.js?

- Node.js is a **JavaScript runtime environment**
- It allows us to run JavaScript **outside the browser**
- Built on **Google Chrome's V8 Engine**
- Mainly used for **backend development**

---

## 🔹 Why Use Node.js for Backend?

- Fast execution (V8 Engine)
- Uses **non-blocking, asynchronous** architecture
- Can handle **multiple requests simultaneously**
- Same language (JavaScript) for frontend and backend

---

## 🔹 Core Concepts Learned

### 1️⃣ JavaScript Runtime

- Node.js provides environment features like:
  - File system access
  - Network requests
  - OS-level operations

---

### 2️⃣ Non-Blocking & Asynchronous Nature

- Node.js does not wait for tasks to finish
- Uses the **event loop** to manage operations efficiently


### 3️⃣ Modules in Node.js


- Code is divided into **modules**
- Types of modules:
  - Core modules (fs, http, path)
  - Local modules

  - Third-party modules (npm packages)


Example:

```js
const fs = require('fs');
