- ✅ Insertion Sort

## 🔹 Selection Sort  

Selection sort works by repeatedly selecting the smallest element from the unsorted part of the array and swapping it with the first unsorted element.  

### Key Points:
- ⏱ Time Complexity: O(n²)  
- Not efficient for large datasets  
- Simple to understand and implement  
- Works by selecting the minimum element in each pass  

### How it works:
1. Find the smallest element  
2. Swap it with the first element  
3. Move to the next position  
4. Repeat until sorted

## 🔹 Insertion Sort  

Insertion sort builds the sorted array one element at a time, similar to how we sort playing cards in our hand.  

### Key Points:
- ⏱ Time Complexity: O(n²) in worst case  
- Good for small datasets  
- More practical than selection sort for small inputs  
- Stable sorting algorithm  

### How it works:
1. Take one element  
2. Compare it with previous elements  
3. Shift elements if needed  
4. Insert it in the correct position

## 🧠 What I practiced today  
- Wrote basic logic of both sorting algorithms  
- Compared Selection Sort vs Insertion Sort  
- Understood real-life analogy of both sorts
