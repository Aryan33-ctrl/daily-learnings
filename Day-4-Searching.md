## 📖 What I Learned

### 🔹 Linear Search
- Checks elements **one by one** from start to end
- Works on **both sorted and unsorted arrays**
- Simple to implement
- Suitable for small datasets

**Time Complexity:**
- Best Case: `O(1)`
- Average Case: `O(n)`
- Worst Case: `O(n)`

**Real-life Example:**  
Searching a name in an unsorted attendance list.

---

### 🔹 Binary Search
- Works only on **sorted arrays**
- Divides the search space into halves
- Much faster than Linear Search for large datasets

**Time Complexity:**
- Best Case: `O(1)`
- Average Case: `O(log n)`
- Worst Case: `O(log n)`

**Real-life Example:**  
Searching a word in a dictionary.

## ⚖️ Comparison: Linear Search vs Binary Search

| Feature | Linear Search | Binary Search |
|------|--------------|---------------|
| Array Type | Sorted / Unsorted | Sorted only |
| Approach | Sequential | Divide & Conquer |
| Time Complexity | O(n) | O(log n) |
| Implementation | Easy | Slightly complex |
| Efficiency | Low for large data | High |
