# Today's Revision – Programming & DSA Fundamentals

## Arrays
- Array traversal using loops
- In-place array modification
- Logical size vs physical array size
- Removing elements without using extra space
- Overwriting values instead of deleting
- Printing only valid elements

## Two Pointer Technique
- Read pointer and write pointer concept
- Filtering elements using pointers
- Single-pass array processing
- When order matters vs when it doesn’t
- Space optimization using pointers

## Loops & Conditions
- for loop and while loop usage
- Loop termination conditions
- if-else decision making
- Boundary and edge case handling
- Avoiding infinite loops

## Time & Space Complexity
- Time complexity basics
- O(n) time for single traversal
- O(1) space for in-place solutions
- Importance of optimized solutions in assessments

## Problem-Solving Skills
- Understanding problem requirements clearly
- Translating logic into code
- Brute force vs optimized thinking
- Ignoring irrelevant data after logical size
- Writing clean and readable code

## Debugging & Dry Run
- Step-by-step dry run
- Tracking pointer movement
- Identifying off-by-one errors
- Verifying final output manually

## Key Takeaway
Two-pointer technique and in-place logic are essential patterns for solving array problems efficiently in exams and interviews.
