## 📌 Today's Learning — LeetCode Contest #485 (My First Contest)

Today I participated in my **first-ever LeetCode Weekly Contest**. It was a new and challenging experience that helped me understand how real-time competitive programming works.

🔹 **Performance**
- Solved **1 out of 4 problems**
- Gave my best attempt on all questions
- Learned how important speed, accuracy, and edge cases are in contests

🔹 **What I Learned**
- How contest interface works on LeetCode  
- How to manage time under pressure  
- Importance of reading the problem carefully  
- Need for faster thinking and better debugging skills  
- Value of practice before contests  

🔹 **Takeaways**
Even though I could solve only one problem, this was an important starting point. I now know my weak areas and will focus on:
- Improving problem-solving speed  
- Practicing more easy/medium problems  
- Strengthening logic and coding skills  

🚀 This is just the beginning of my competitive programming journey!
