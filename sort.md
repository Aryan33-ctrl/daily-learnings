### ⚙️ Merge Sort
- Recursive divide into halves
- Merge sorted arrays
- Time Complexity: O(n log n)
- Stable algorithm
- Uses extra memory

### ⚡ Quick Sort
- Pivot-based sorting
- Partition method
- Average Time: O(n log n)
- Worst Case: O(n²)
- In-place sorting

### 🔍 Comparison
- Merge Sort → Stable, extra space
- Quick Sort → Faster practically, unstable
